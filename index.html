<h1>RNGMAX Privacy Policy and TOS</h1>
<h3>RNGMAX stores one piece of data from your server members: their message sent count. The only data it interacts with is through the Discord API, and will use this to: reply and recieve commands, check it's own permissions to see if it has Embed Links, and update a server's command list when outdated. This bot does not log anything besides the pure numbers of messages a member has sent and has no per server configuration. The only permissions nessecary are View Channels, Embed Links, and Send Messages (+ Send Messages in Threads). The chart command uses the API <a href="https://quickchart.io" target="_blank">https://quickchart.io</a> which recieves no data from anything besides what the output of the command would be</h3>
<h4>It uses all / commands, and you can use /help to view them. If you'd like to add this bot for your own server, I'd be happy! <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1255783245337853983&permissions=19456&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands" target="_blank">Click Here to add the bot</a></h4>
<p>I might make this into a nicer looking website later but for now this is what it will look like until I change it.</p>
