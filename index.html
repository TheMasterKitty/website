<h1>RNGMAX Privacy Policy and TOS</h1>
<h3>RNGMAX stores one piece of data from your server members: their message sent count. The only data it interacts with is through the Discord API, and will use this to: reply and recieve commands, check it's own permissions to see if it has Embed Links, and update a server's command list when outdated. This bot does not log anything besides a command statistic count logging the amount of times a command has been run globally (does not record which user ran the command or which server the command was ran in) and the time the command was run to be able to sort by hourly/daily/weekly statistics, and user + server specified configuration via /user-settings and /server-settings. The only permissions necessary are View Channels, Embed Links, and Send Messages (+ Send Messages in Threads for commands in Forum Posts / Threads).</h3>
<h4>It uses all / commands, and you can use /help to view them. If you'd like to add this bot for your own server, I'd be quite happy! <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1255783245337853983&permissions=19456&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands" target="_blank">Click Here to add the bot</a></h4>
<p>This can be updated at any time, but updates/changes will be posted in <a href="https://discord.gg/bMeFfcGEsu" target="_blank">the support server [click here]</a>.<br>I might make this into a nicer looking website later but for now this is what it will look like until I change it.</p>
